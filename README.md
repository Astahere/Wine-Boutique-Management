## Getting Started

Please install Dbeaver for connecting the online database for recording your score.

### Prerequisites

Please install the latest version of Dbeaver

## Usage

The game is based on one year period, so it consists of 52 weeks (rounds). In some weeks, we add in some surge demand period such as Christmas and Chinese New Year to enhance the reality and playability, so please be prepared in advance to satisft customer demand. However, in the game, another challenge is to balnace the transportation cost and holding cost so you have to think carefully on when and how many to order. The final goal of the game is to optimize the cash balance at the end of week 52. You can see your rank in the "Leaderboard" Tab. By the way. there are some hints and information in the "Info" Tab, please read through it before starting the game for the higher rank!!
